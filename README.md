# Statistical experiments with stock data

The purpose of this repository is to hold various mostly one-off experiments.

The idea is to implement various statistics, graphs, stock screeners here first,
and once they prove useful and somewhat mature, they can migrate to the main
`stockparfait` repository as a "production" version.
