# Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals and Monte Carlo Method

*Previous: [Distribution of Log-Profits]*

In this experiment, we establish a methodology for working with sampled data and
estimating the precision of the results. Note, that unlike most other
experiments, we will be working exclusively with analytical distributions, and
therefore, will not need any external data.

- [Theory](theory.md): definitions of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals
  under hypothesis, Monte Carlo method, and introducing basic statistics
- [Normal distributinon](normal.md): simulating normal distribution with
  `N=250`, `5K` and `20M` samples, evaluating CIs for basic statistics
- [Student's t-distribution](students.md): the same simulation of t-distribution
- [The Tale of Fat Tails](fat_tails.md): finding `a` (alpha) parameter of
  t-distribution by simulation
